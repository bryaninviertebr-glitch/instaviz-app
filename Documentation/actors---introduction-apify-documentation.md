The API endpoints in this section allow you to manage Apify Actors. For more details about Actors, refer to the [Actor documentation](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors).

For API endpoints that require the `actorId` parameter to identify an Actor, you can provide either:

- The Actor ID (e.g., `HG7ML7M8z78YcAPEB`), or
- A tilde-separated combination of the Actor owner's username and the Actor name (e.g., `janedoe~my-actor`).
