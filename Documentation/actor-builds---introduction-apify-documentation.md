The API endpoints described in this section enable you to manage, and delete Apify Actor builds.

Note that if any returned build object contains usage in dollars, your effective
unit pricing at the time of query has been used for computation of this dollar equivalent, and hence it should be
used only for informative purposes.

You can learn more about platform usage in the [documentation](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/running/usage-and-resources#usage).
